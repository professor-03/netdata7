# netdata7
This is my 7th project as an intern at elevate labs. I have to visualize system and app perfomance metrices using netdata.

Steps that i took to make this project a successfull one:

-Created an ec2 instance and installed docker on it.

-Run via Docker: docker run -d --name=netdata -p 19999:19999 netdata/netdata and Access at http://localhost:19999.

-The dashboard of netdata wasn't accessible through college wifi after repeated alteration.

-But it was accessible through the mobile service provider so yeah did the project after failing many times due to network settings but yeah enjoyed the process.
